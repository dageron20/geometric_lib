# Unit tests
> The "tests" folder contains the files
> tests of the perimeter and area functions of various figures, which are presented in the "readme".
> Each shape test file includes a test case and a class with two functions: one for testing area, the other for perimeter.

## About functions
> All functions are focused on checking two key factors:
> * Checks whether the correct data type came into the function;
> * Check the correctness of calculations.
## All list of functions:
1) test_circle_area(self);
2) test_circle_perimeter(self);
3) test_rectangle_area(self);
4) test_rectangle_perimeter(self);
5) test_square_area(self);
6) test_square_perimeter(self);
7) test_triangle_area(self);
8) test_triangle_perimeter(self);
